5.0,"For me it’s the best deal in town —mainly the bunkbed room. Other hotel has no extra bed, hence we have to pay 2 rooms for 3 person. Everything is clean, and you’re getting what you paid for. It’s quiet, all staff is very friendly and they greet you all the time with sincere smile. The security is also helpful with the parkings. I personally hate that they’re not providing toothpaste and toothbrush. But I have to agree as this once-twice only used toothbrush is adding up rubbish, while our world is currently strangled by plastic waste. The shower room is compact, but you should provide place to hang towel and personal’s soap/shampoo. Highly recommended, it’s among the best budget hotel I’ve ever stayed in!"
5.0,"Room is basic and small, but that's why it's for us whose on a budget. Regardless small, the room is clean and comfy. Only essential amenities are included. Not much of a spare room to open your luggage or for doing prayers. Nice if you want a quick and easy place to stay in semarang"
4.0,"I found the room quite funny when i arrived, they put the shower in the bedroom, so i can hear my roomate doing everything on the shower (lol), they also did not have decent space in the room, i ask for a double bed but it feels like a single bed because there is no gap between the beds (lol again). But i guess its enough for the price i got and the access to the city is nice."
1.0,"Unfortunately, we had unpleasant experience. Book 2 rooms for 2 nights with Agoda. On the way there, we were informed only 1 night available. After several calls we got the rooms that we have booked. On second night, we went back to hotel, no parking space, adviced to park at Novotel, but no parking space left at Novotel either. We went back to the hotel and there was no clean water, hotel under maintenance until unknown schedule. The next morning there are no clean water at all, the pump is broken and no known schedule when it's going to be repaired. Solution provided, use bathroom in Novotel :-\ . Hotel should have a backup pump. I would not recommend this hotel, especially on high season. Poor service."
5.0,"The room is clean and comfortable. We especially enjoyed the bunk bed that enabled the three of us to stay in the same room. The compact shower with the hot water is convenient to use. Yet, the best thing of the hotel is its strategic location as we can conveniently reach the city center on foot."
4.0,"It’s a nice small budget hotel. Located in the city center, close to Poncol & Tawang train stations, decent budget meals, separate shower & toilet, extra bunk bed available (for kids kids under 6), soap & shampoo only located in the shower, and only towels are available (they don’t provide toothbrush & toothpaste, & no slippers). Cleanliness is average. There’s not much space if you need to work on your laptop. All and all it’s pretty decent for a budget hotel."
1.0,"The room was dirty, breakfast was untasted. Very disappointment remembering ibis is accor member.Rooms: 1/5 | Service: 1/5 | Location: 4/5 …More"
3.0,"I can't say much about the budget room, everything is indeed very budget. I would not recommend for guests with height above 1,7m.. the double bed is really small, you won't have much space in the shower nor in the toilet room. I dont even know where to put my 65L backpack. Anyway the bed is pretty comfortable for me for a short sleep. Will recommend this for a very short transit only"
4.0,"Located in a very strategic place, near the train station. A very reasonable price for a budget hotel. The staff and the security are very polite and helpful. The room service is good. The hotel is clean. The room is very clean although it's quite narrow but still ok. They toilet and the shower are provided separately which is a good design. Unfortunately the towels are old, and an extra charge for having toothpaste, toothbrush and sandals. The breakfast menu is delicious enough, but they don't serve jasmine tea as an optional drink. But overall, it's very nice staying there."
5.0,"The hotel was clean and the linen was comfortable. It took 30munites from semarang airport to this hotel. The room was small but no complaint compared to the very cheap prize. The breakfast was there, good enough, although limited choices. The staff was helpfull and check in-out time was so fast."
