3.0,"(Translated by Google) When you want to check in, you already have a full payment via transfer via the cooking application, you want to be told to pay again for the reason that the data hasn't been entered, wkwk Wait for confirmation, it's a waste of time The new building maybe the cleanliness of the toilets can be improved even more. The shower was not used for too long, the water immediately seeped out under the mattress, the AC was cold, the TV was clear. over all it's pretty good at that price (Original) Waktu mau check in kan sudah full payment lewat transfer via aplikasi masak mau disuruh bayar lagi dengan alesan data belum masuk wkwk Nunggu konfirmasi aja lama buangettt Bangunan baru mungkin kebersihan toilet nya lebih ditingkatkan lagi. Shower dipake ngga terlalu lama aja air langsung rembes keluar sampe bawah kasur, AC dingin, tv jernih. over all lumayan kalo harga segitu"

1.0,"(Translated by Google) The price is quite expensive, Minus my room has no hot water (Original) Harganya lumayan mahal, Minus kamar saya tidak ada air panas"
5.0,"(Translated by Google) The staff is nice and very friendly. The hotel is clean but for maintenance in the room can be improved again, because there are hairs in the room as well as the bathroom area. And also the hot water heater sometimes doesn't work. The parking lot is quite spacious and if it's full, just leave the car keys at the receptionist, they will handle it. (Original) Staf baik dan sangat ramah. Hotelnya bersih tapi untuk perawatan didalam kamar bisa ditingkatkan lagi, karena ada terdapat rambut2 didalam kamar juga area kamar mandi. Dan juga water heaternya panas kadang tidak berfungsi. Parkiran cukup luas dan kalo penuh cukup titipkan kunci mobil di receptionist, mereka yang handle."
4.0,"(Translated by Google) Forgot to take a photo of the room,,, For rooms, it's standard, comfortable beds, air conditioning, TV is available, but only local broadcasts (not complete and sometimes messy), for bathrooms with no hot water, shower n sitting toilet... you can get toiletries too Cleanliness is enough, standard prices too.. (Original) Lupa mau ngefoto kamarnya,, Utk kamar, standar aja, kasur nyaman, ac, tivi ada namun siaran lokal aja (ga lengkap n bruwet kadang2), utk kamar mandi no air panas, shower n wc duduk.. dpt toiletries juga Kebersihan cukup lah, harga standar juga.."

5.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is okay for that price, very affordable, the facilities are okay, the staff is also friendly. But some of the front room doors are broken, so you can't use a card, you have to use a key (Original) Tempatnya oke buat harga segitu, sangat terjangkau, fasilitas oke, stafnya jg ramah. Tp beberapa pintu kamar yg depan rusak, jd gabisa make kartu, harus make kunci"

4.0,"(Translated by Google) the location is strategic because it is on the edge of the highway and close to mininarkets such as Indomaret and Alfamidi, also close to places to eat. in front of the hotel there is a soto stall too. the building is nice and instagramable especially the stairs. the rooms are nice, and in each room there are also toiletries and mineral water, unfortunately the bathroom in my room was not clean, there were dirt and hair in the drains. maybe a former guest before, and there is no mat in the room, so if you run out of the bathroom, make the floor muddy and wet. it would be great to add a doormat in each room. (Original) lokasinya strategis karena berada di pinggir jalan raya dan dekat dengan mininarket seperti indomaret dan alfamidi, juga dekat dengan tempat makan. di depan hotel ada warung soto juga. bangunannya bagus dan instagramable apalagi tangga nya. kamarnya bagus, dan di setiap kamar juga sudah ada peralatan mandi dan air mineral, sayangnya kamar mandinya di kamar saya kurang bersih, ada kotoran-kotoran dan rambut di saluran air. mungkin bekas tamu sebelumnya, dan di kamar tidak tersedia keset, sehingga kalau habis dari kamar mandi, membuat lantainya becek dan basah. akan lebih bagus kalau ditambahin keset di setiap kamarnya."
