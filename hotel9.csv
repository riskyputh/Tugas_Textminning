3.0,"Stay for one night, good for short term staying, not recommended for long one. We have no shower cap provided in the room, with the sink and the bathroom drainage not running well. Overall, the bed is cozy, and the room is nice and homie."

5.0,Aston hotels have been our family's go-to hotels and they have never failedto meet our expectations. The room service have always been on-point and the staff are very courteous. Special requests such as extra towels and slippers are always provided with gusto. The buffet breakfast never seizes to amaze (especially the made to order eggs that are cooked to your liking). Aston will always have a special place in my family's heart. Kudos to your above and beyond service with a smile. üòäüôè
4.0,"We stayed at their suite room with anniversary decoration, and they gave us nice decor. The facilities are quite complete, and we were quite thrilled when there was a nescafe machine to make various drinks at our room. Unfortunately the machine was not working well. They technician has never came to our room after we contact them, but the restaurant has offered compensations to order the drinks from them and they will deliver it to our room. We made the order via phone, and after 30 min nobody deliver the drinks to our room until we've been felt asleep. Basically we'll love to stay at this hotel again, since their location is quite strategic. However, there are several customer focus aspect that need to be improved for sure."
3.0,"Good for family vacation, strategic location, near pusat oleh oleh, clean and sanitized room . This is for my first visit, we got 12th floor rooms, the light sources is no good, too bright and different colors. The second visit, we got 5th floor rooms, it is awful, air-conditioning not cool, drainage from shower and wash basin not good, television is not good to watch"
