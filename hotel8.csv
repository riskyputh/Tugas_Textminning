5.0,"i'd tried connecting room, the room is giid but the size of room is not big enough either the shower roomRooms: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Location: 5/5 â€¦More"
3.0,"The hotel's location is quite strategic in front of the ""Simpang lima"" intersection, but not in accordance with 4-star facilities. The parking space is narrow, you have to be a good driver to park here. It is not recommended for those who bring their own vehicle. The hotel lobby is hot, the restaurant is not up to 4 star standards. There is nothing to expect on the 2 star breakfast menu even though they want to deliver breakfast to the room. The condition of the room is quite clean, the AC is cold and the bed is comfortable."
4.0,"The hotel was good, clean, and I love the pool very much, but the bathroom is very small. This hotel located at a strategic location, near the Simpang Lima where you can find various local culinary with affordable price. Just in case you don't want to try hotel's food."
1.0,"Strategic location, new hotel, but horrible service. We got woken up at midnight due to payment method issue (3rd party app), which was resolved in the morning. Unprofessional, it's should not be the customer's problem if you are unable to manage your accounting/booking system."
4.0,"Great location, but the apartment staff needs to be more helpful and friendly. The apartment reception looks messy and dirty. The parking space is out of this world: DO NOT park here unless you want to try your skills on how to turn in an extremely narrow turns while going up and down"
4.0,"Stayed thers for a day. Place is strategic, but the entrance is not friendly. Hotel guest must go down by stair to access the elevator in the rear, which is ineffective since we are bringing our luggage. Parking space at the building is not comfortable, too narrow, I saw many vehicles got scratch there. Hotel room is pretty good. Pretty clean. Breakfast is not available during PPKM. Pool has outstanding view. But they are lack of lights, they say it open until 9 pm, but around 6 pm, pool area is very very extremely dark. No staff or pool guard at all. I have to travel down to ground wearing towel to ask for light."
2.0,"Extremely dirty, bathrooms are too small, not worth the price. Very dissapointed"
4.0,"maybe because this pandemic so the elevator only 1 can be use so u must wait little bit long ,and the parking area is very small must have a good skill , the hotel is good and comfortable"
3.0,"I wouldn't necessarily call this a luxury hotel. Yes, it's well located, just right by Simpang Lima, the heart of the city. Rooms are spacious and quite comfy. However, walls are thin, and it's not well maintained and there are spots that need to be better cleaned around the premise. If breakfast is not included in your fare, don't bother. The breakfast is very limited (space and the menu), it's a lot better to have breakfast in other restaurant nearby."
5.0,"The location is great (at simpang lima). Room is clean although the bathroom quite small. The only thing to note is the parking lot is really small. If you have big car (alphard, serena, etc), go into the parking lot is tough"
