2.0,"I don't know why this hotel got a high rating.. this is an old building.. with extra prices.. be careful when you booked online.. cause this hotel provide you with a trap.. ""not include breakfast"".. then they will charge you with more extra prices for the breakfast.. I feel somehow there's a strange smell in the corner of your nose when you entered the lift, the hall and the room.. you knew it and you feel it.. but you cant do anything about it.. Some spots are Instagrammable but the services that you'll get will be a standard like any other hotels.."

5.0,They have this concept of using artistic paintings as decorations and I personally like it. The room was comfortable and aesthetic. And the service was really great. The employees are so friendly and welcoming. Love it.

4.0,Comfortable bed and clean room but bathroom needs renovation (plumbing is outdated). Also only 1 of 2 elevators functional.
5.0,"Quite place for a family stay as well as business trip. One if the very rare hotel in the capital of Central Java having nice swimming pool, tennis court and great gym as well as spa. The rooms are recently refurbished and are quite spacy; amenities are good; room rate are interestingly competitive compare with other newer hotels. Good restaurants are available at its vicinity within walking distance."
3.0,"Not so special for me. It's pretty far from the city. The room is average. The sink had problem, which was absorbed very slow that made the shower floor become a puddle. The breakfast was ok. Swimming pool wasn't something great, small size. And during my stay, it was on maintenance. The gym was ok. The staff was superb! The aircon works fine."
5.0,"A renovate hotel , being a 5 stars for more than a decade , and still got the very good hotel image , so comfort , have a nice lounge , a tasty chinese restaurant , also a good all you can eat buffet for breakfast. Being there for several wedding and birthday party at their ballroom , is a good experience also an honour to come there. With a huge lobby , very interesting art statue at lobby , and also they got live music every weekend , so we can enjoy the lounge very well. If you go to the 10th floor , they have a very nice lounge if we want a more private and quite meeting with friends or family."
